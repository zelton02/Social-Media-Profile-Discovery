# Social Media Discovery New PLan

1. Holehe Method: Use “register” or “email availability” endpoints to see if an email is already taken. Sometimes use “login/forgot password” flows that leak account existence. Extract CSRF tokens from a preflight GET when required. Map response JSON or error messages to exists/rateLimit/error fields in a standard output dict.

2. Username search - Many creators maintain consistent usernames across platforms for brand recognition, making this approach highly effective. Do search for matching or similar usernames across target platforms including Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch.

3. Email address approach (High difficulty): Big platforms have deliberately locked down email-based searches over the past decade to protect user privacy and prevent abuse.

4. Reverse image / content search: Using Google Images to find the same image on the other site.

5. The user might expose their account on another social media platform from their bio.
